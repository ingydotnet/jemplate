= HACKING

To be able to build Jemplate you must first set up Dist::Zilla.

% cpanm Dist::Zilla
% dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
% dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm

At this point the following command should complete successfully:

% dzil build

= TESTING

The tests rely on Test::Base, as configured by the Dist::Zilla Plugin
TestBaseIncluder. To run the tests you must have the git repository of
Test::Base available in the parent directory!

% git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/test-base-pm.git ../test-base-pm

At this point the following command should complete successfully:

% dzil test --release
