TODO: Does use_test_base not work? make test compains that Test::Base is not installed -rokr
    
FUTURE:

09:55 < nkuttler_> apparently firefox sets the accept header to request xml rather than json, which obviously is incompatible with later JSON.parse calls. I have added a 
                  req.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/x-json"); to Jemplate.js to fix that. any comments?
10:05 < nkuttler_> kind of makes sense to me as jemplate can only handle json, at least atm

       var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
       req.open('GET', url, Boolean(callback));
       req.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'text/x-json');
           return Ajax._send(req, null, callback);
       }

14:13 < nkuttler> hm, it could break servers that don't understand x-json but expect text/json or application/json
14:14 < nkuttler> hm, application/json http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt
14:16 < nkuttler> maybe rather something like req.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'text/json; text/x-json; application/json');


 - Integrate debugging with Firebug
 - Better warnings (provide context of fault, e.g. which template?) on bad stash data (lists, etc).

Integrate different frameworks for Ajax/JSON processing and 
encaspulate Jemplate code so it can play nice with other javascript:

    --runtime           Is equivalent to --ajax=ilinsky --json=json2
                        Need to do testing of ilinsky to see if it's a better choice than gregory, but
                        looks like it (and still has active and recent development).

    --runtime-lite      Same as --ajax=none --json=none
    --runtime-jquery    Same as --ajax=jquery --json=none
    --runtime-yui       Same as --ajax=yui --json=yui
    --runtime-legacy    Same as --ajax=gregory --json=json2

    --json              By itself, equivalent to --json=json2
    --json=json2        Use http://www.json.org/json2.js for parsing/stringifying (bundle)
    --json=yui          Use YUI: YAHOO.lang.JSON
    --json=none         Doesn't provide any functionality except a warning
    
    --ajax              By itself, equivalent to --ajax=ilinsky
    --ajax=jquery       Use jQuery for Ajax get and post (external)
    --ajax=yui          Use YUI: yui/connection/connection.js (external)
    --ajax=ilinsky      Use http://code.google.com/p/xmlhttprequest/ (bundle)
    --ajax=gregory      Use http://www.scss.com.au/family/andrew/webdesign/xmlhttprequest/ (bundle)
    --ajax=none         Doesn't provide any functionality except a warning

    --xxx               Include XXX and JJJ helper functions (bundle, of course)

    --ilinsky-xhr       Provide Ilinsky's XmlHttpRequest regardless of which Ajax framework is
                        chosen.

    --minify                                Pass output through JavaScript::Minifier
    --minify=/path/to/yuicompressor         Pass output through an exec java using the specified yuicompressor.jar

=== 0.21

- Use array for output
- Option to include template source as comments
- Put all Jemplate code into a standalone script
- Test INCLUDE_PATH
- Rewrite docs
- Support JavaScript compression

=== 0.20

+ Fix test failures.

=== 0.19

+ Better Getopt::Long processing
+ Option to preserve template paths.
+ Support Jemplate objects. Jemplate->new({options})->process;
+ Allow multiple compilations to work together.
x Option to bundle Jemplate.js runtime

+ Test --runtime == share/Jemplate.js
+ Test --list
+ Test --start-tag and JEMPLATE_START_TAG etc
+ Test multiple compile files
+ Test DEBUG_UNDEF
+ Test subdir templates

+ Change list output
+ make manifest


=== This is a list of things for you to do. Feel free to do them or add to the
list.

+ Fix test harness output on IE. It currently shows up on one line.

- Write tests to make sure all the `process` API variations work (on all
  browsers. This has bit me already.

+ Implement the hash virtual methods
- Finish implementing the standard filters

+ Make foo.bar() compile to stash.get('foo', 0, 'bar', [])
+ Make sure stash calls some function in that case.

- Finish the following directives:
  - MACRO
  - TRY/CATCH/FINAL
  - THROW
  + DEFAULT
  - META
  - INSERT
  - FILTER
  - USE 

- Implement plugin support for javascript libraries.

- Port popular TT plugin modules

- Write a tutorial pod

+ TT supports stash localization within a template. Jemplate should do this.

=== Add Experimental Ajax/Json/Stash support

If a template says:

[% JSON foo.bar -> 'data/bar.json' %]

then access to foo.bar will trigger a synchronous call to the uri
'data/bar.json'. Even access to foo.bar.baz would trigger it before baz was
looked up in the result.

The idea is that this allows some client side templates to use serverside
logic. And conditionally at that.

Any subsequent calls to foo.bar.* should use the cached data.

It is likely that the stash should be localized. So that other templates
access to foo.bar did not use this.
