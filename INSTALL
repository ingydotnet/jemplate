== The Jemplate Compiler ==

The program called 'jemplate' that is next to this INSTALL file is a
standalone compiler for Jemplate. It has no dependencies except that there
must be a 'perl' executable command in your PATH. (Most machines come with
Perl preinstalled these days.)

To use Jemplate, just download this compiler and put it in your bin PATH.
That's it.

To get help on the Jemplate compiler, run this command:

    jemplate --help

--Ingy döt Net
